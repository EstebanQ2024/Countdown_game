"""
Brute-force solver for the Countdown numbers game.

Given a set of numbers and a target, this script tries to reach the target using arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
It uses recursion and memoization to efficiently search for solutions and keeps track of the closest result found.

Algorithm stops once any solution is found, the search is exhausted, or the maximum number of calls is reached.
If no exact solution is found, it returns the closest number achieved and the sequence of operations.

Output includes:
- The sequence of operations leading to the solution or closest result
- Search statistics: number of operation calls, cache size, cache hits, and most frequent operation
